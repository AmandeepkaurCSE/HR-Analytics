### Observations
The attrition rate in the company is 24%.

Mostly employees preferred to stay either for 2 or 3 years working in a company . 

Employees in the sector sales, technical and support are having least satisfaction rate in the company.

Even though ,employees whose last evaluation rate is high in different department are leaving the company.

### Reason to Churn Out
Employees who are not getting any promotion after five years of working in a company are basically more prone to be churn out.
For example, Employees of department of sales, technical and support are about to leave company because these departments are least promoted in the company.

Employees getting more number of projects are preferred to stay in the company and vice versa.
Letâ€™s take an example in order to demonstrate it,  Employees having 3 or 4 number of projects are more willing to stay in the company than those who are getting only 2 number of project

Employees getting less salary about to leave  the company and vice versa.

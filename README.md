### Notable Findings
The company's attrition rate currently stands at 24%.

A predominant pattern indicates that employees commonly opt to continue their tenure for either 2 or 3 years within the organization.

Satisfaction levels among employees in the sales, technical, and support sectors appear to be notably lower compared to other departments.

Curiously, even employees with high performance evaluations in various departments are choosing to depart from the company.

### Reason to Employee attrition
Employees who do not receive promotions within a five-year timeframe are at a heightened risk of attrition. This tendency is particularly evident in departments like sales, technical, and support, where promotional opportunities are comparatively scarce.

The inclination to remain with the company is notably stronger among employees who are assigned a higher volume of projects. To illustrate, individuals managing three or four projects exhibit a greater willingness to stay within the organization than those with only two projects.

A significant factor influencing employee departure is inadequate compensation, wherein individuals receiving lower salaries are more inclined to seek opportunities elsewhere. Conversely, higher remuneration contributes to enhanced employee retention.

### Strategies to Recommend to reduce attrition rate
Promotions should be granted to employees after completing five years of tenure within the company. Additionally, salary increments should be implemented across departments such as sales, support, and technical, in order to enhance the likelihood of retaining valuable employees.

In my viewpoint, adopting a strategy where promotions are offered after five years of service could significantly contribute to prolonging employees' tenure beyond three years. Furthermore, it is advisable to consider raising salaries in departments where employee compensation is comparatively lower.
